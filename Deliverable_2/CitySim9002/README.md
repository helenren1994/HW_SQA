1.The first problem that my java skill is not that good so as to I have to learn how to write in java from the very beginning. I have talked to a lot of people who are excellent in java programming and they really gave me useful advice. Then, after one week struggling with java programming, finally I started this project one week before the due.

2. Soon, I found another problem, since I am really lack of experience about java programming and the whole process about testing, I did not consider how to test while coding. So it directly leads to a dilemma that the code is not easy to test. At first, I only have likeOrNot() method to deal with logic of going to a location and like it or not. Then I realize visit(Visitor v, String location) method should be used, but this method still not that good. So, the result is not that good when testing visit() in CitySim9002 class and likeOrNot() method in Visitor class.
 
3. I made a mistake which is I mocked the class that I was testing.

4. I do not know how to write the testGenerate() test case which is supposed to the generateVisitor() method in CitySim9002 class could return correct visitor according to type it received. I could not found an assertion to compare two objectsâ€™ type.
